          I build performant, scalable web applications using JavaScript, React, and Angular â€”
          writing code that goes beyond the UI. I enjoy solving complex problems, architecting
          maintainable frontends, and obsessing over the details that make apps fast, accessible,
          and reliable.

          Lately, I've been exploring machine learning and generative AI which I can leverage as
          powerful tools across development workflows, from documentation to testing and beyond.

        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I'm probably making something cutsie with polymer clay, crocheting,
          or befriending every cat and dog I meet!
